Load the ciphertext string.
Convert ciphertext into a cipherlist to split out individual words.
Get input for the number of columns and rows.
Get input for the key.
Convert key into a list to split out individual numbers.
Create a new list for the translation matrix.
For every number in the key:
	Create a new list and append every n items (n = # in rows) from the cipherlist.
	Use the sign of key number to decide whether to read the row forward or backward.
	Using the chosen direction. add the new list to the matrix. The index of each new list is based on the column number used in the key.
Create a new string to hold translation results.
For range of rows:
	For the nested list in translation matrix:
		Remove the last word in nested list
		Add the word to the translation string.
Print the translation string.
